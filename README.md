## The Problem We're Solving

Students face a unique financial challenge that generic budgeting apps don't understand:

- **Irregular Income**: Loans, family support, and side gigs don't follow salary patterns
- **Fixed Campus Costs**: Rent, fees, and transport eat up most of the budget
- **Cultural Context Matters**: Sukuma wiki costs 10 KSh in Kakamega but 50 KSh in Nairobi
- **Survival vs. Budgeting**: Students need to know "Will I make it to month-end?" not just track expenses

**The Reality**: Students are skipping meals and dropping out because they can't navigate financial uncertainty.

## Our Solution

Campus Survival Coach answers one critical question: **"Can I survive until my next disbursement?"**

Unlike traditional budgeting apps, we focus on **student financial survival** with:

### Core Features

- **Financial Runway Calculator**
  - Handles irregular income patterns (lump sums, delayed disbursements)
  - Calculates exact days until "broke" and safe daily spending
  - Warns before financial crisis points

- **Smart Trade-off Analysis**
  - Visualize housing vs transport vs food budget decisions
  - Compare "On-campus + walking" vs "Off-campus + matatu" scenarios
  - Identify impossible financial combinations before you commit

- **AI-Powered Survival Tips**
  - Contextual advice based on your campus type and living situation
  - Cultural awareness (local food options, transport hacks)
  - Crisis mode prioritization for tight financial situations

- **Cultural Context Intelligence**
  - Campus-specific cost data (rural vs town vs city)
  - Local food options and survival strategies
  - Understanding of student life realities

### User Experience

- **Mobile-First Design**: Built for students on the go
- **Instant Calculations**: No complex setup or bank connections
- **Student-Friendly Language**: "Days until broke" not "cash flow projections"
- **Offline Capable**: Works without internet after initial setup

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React 18 + TypeScript for type-safe development
- Vite for lightning-fast development and builds
- Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive styling

**Intelligence & Data**
- Google Gemini API for AI-powered survival tips
- Local Storage for data persistence (no backend needed)
- Static JSON for campus context data

**Quality & Testing**
- Vitest for unit testing
- fast-check for property-based testing
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- Professional commit conventions

**Deployment**
- Vercel for instant, free deployment
- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Mobile-optimized performance

## 📱 Usage Examples

<!-- TODO: Add actual screenshots when UI is complete -->

### 1. Calculate Your Financial Runway
```
Current Balance: 15,000 KSh
Expected Income: 25,000 KSh (Jan 15)
Fixed Costs: 8,000 KSh/month

Result: 23 days remaining, 450 KSh safe daily spend
```

### 2. Compare Living Options
```
Option A: On-campus (12,000 KSh) + Walking
→ Food Budget: 650 KSh/day

Option B: Off-campus (8,000 KSh) + Daily Matatu (200 KSh)
→ Food Budget: 450 KSh/day
```

### 3. Get AI Survival Tips
```
"Given your 450 KSh daily budget in Nairobi, consider:
- Campus canteen lunch (150 KSh) + home cooking dinner
- Avoid CBD fast food, stick to campus kiosks
- Walk when possible, save matatu for essentials"
```
